# What is Gemcutter?
Gemcutter is a free C++ game development framework for Windows. It features a powerful Entity-Component-System
and fine-grain control of both 2D and 3D rendering.

# Why use Gemcutter?
Gemcutter provides a programmer-centric modern C++ workflow that is expressive yet succinct.

The API is kept slim with a philosophy of minimizing boilerplate and unifying code paths.
For example: `Widgets`, `Sprites`, `Meshes`, and `Particles` all render the same way - a Renderable component with a Material and VertexArray.

Highlight features include:
* [A rich shader workflow](docs/Shader.md)
* [Queryable Entity-Component-System](docs/Entity.md)
* [Extendable asset management](docs/AssetManager.md)
* Run-time reflection
* A modular & extendable particle system
* Audio powered by [SoLoud](https://github.com/EmilianC/soloud)
* Mesh and Texture loading
* Dynamic GUI widgets
* [FreeType text rendering](docs/Text.md)
* Event handling & lifetime-safe delegates
* A robust fixed-timestep gameloop
* Keyboard/Mouse/Xbox-Controller support
* [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) integration
* A complete math library
* Local networking

# Quick Start
If you're looking to start a new project using Gemcutter, then you can use [this repository template](https://github.com/EmilianC/Gemcutter-Project-Template) to get started quickly.

If you just want to download the framework, then simply clone the repo and configure the project with CMake from the root folder:
```
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..                       # Default configuration, or
> cmake .. -DENABLE_SAMPLES=OFF  # Default configuration without downloading samples
```
And that's it! Any required git submodules are pulled automatically. You'll find your generated projects under the `build/` folder. Code samples can be found under `samples/` if they were enabled.

The following build configurations will be available:
| Config         | defines            | optimizations | asserts | tools |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Debug          | GEM_DEBUG, GEM_DEV | off           | on      | on    |
| RelWithDebInfo | GEM_DEV            | on            | off     | on    |
| Release        | GEM_PRODUCTION     | on            | off     | off   |
