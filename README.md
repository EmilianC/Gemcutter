# What is Jewel3D?
Jewel3D is a free C++ game development framework for Windows. It features a powerful Entity-Component-System
and fine-grain control of both 2D and 3D rendering.

# Why use Jewel3D?
The framework facilitates expressive and succinct code that is both easy to read, and to use.
With a thin API and modern C++14 concepts, Jewel3D provides powerful features without feeling clunky.

Highlight features include:
* [A Rich shader workflow](Resources/Docs/Shader.md)
* [Efficient entity queries](Resources/Docs/Entity.md)
* [Extendable asset management](Resources/Docs/AssetManager.md)
* A modular and extendable particle system
* Audio powered by OpenAL
* Mesh and Texture loading
* [FreeType driven Text rendering](Resources/Docs/Text.md)
* Event dispatching and response
* Robust fixed-timestep updates
* A complete math library
* Keyboard/Mouse/Xbox-Gamepad support
* Local networking

# Quick Start
1. Run "INSTALL.cmd" to save the checkout path to the environment and install project templates.
	- You might have to restart your computer for this to take effect.
2. Run "BUILD.cmd" to compile the engine and tools.
3. Create a new game project by selecting ```Add New Project -> Visual C++ -> Jewel3D Project```. 
	- Due to a known bug in Visual Studio, source files are missing from the template project. 
	- Feel free to manually copy the project from ```\Jewel3D\Tools\TemplateProject\``` until this is fixed.
	- Includes and link dependencies are still set up correctly.
